    "Observers are now able to detect different molecules in the atmopshere of exoplanets. Thanks to this, it is possible to use 3D climate models (Global Climate Models) or simpler 1D climate models to study the climate of exoplanets and thus their habitability. But keep in mind that \"habitable\" does not mean that Humans can live or travel there.  *''There is no planet B'' as Michel Mayor says !*\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the study of the climate of a planet is to compute the atmopsheric profiles of that planet. These profiles are then used in 1D models to compute the radiative transfer of the atmopshere to obtain information on the absorbed and emitted fluxes. GCMs (3D models) also take into account the dynamics and other complex processes (advection, clouds, ocean etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is to compute the pressure and temperature profiles of an atmosphere, assuming surface pressure and temperature. You have learned with David Ehrenreich what is a lapse rate and how compute it. Here, we will see how use it. \n",
    "First we will compute the profiles of a dry atmosphere. Then we will take into account the condensation of water to compute the profiles of a wet atmosphere. Finally we will produce profiles for a more general case where the atmopshere can be dry or wet depending on the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we will study only one-component atmospheres. You will find with this notebook two python files: \"phys.py\" and \"planets.py\". The first one provides gas parameters for multiples gases and the second one provides planet parameters. See examples below to learn how to use these modules.\n",
    "There are also data files which contain the real temperature vs pressure profile for different planets and moons (*Venus.dat*, *Earth.dat*, *Mars.dat*, *Jupiter.dat*, *Titan.dat*)\n",
